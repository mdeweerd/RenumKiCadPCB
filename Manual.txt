This program automatically renumbers a KiCad PCB according to various rules (see options below).
It then back-annotates the renumbering scheme into the schematic hierarchy.

This makes finding components on the PCB very easy.

Note:

V0.2 	has a rudimentary menu interface as an option. Some command line options have changed so
		they make more sense.

V0.2 	Was developed under MSYS on Windows so it is standalone (no DLL required). 
		It has been tested on Ubuntu Linux.


V0.201 	added storing of parameter names by default so you don't have to keep retyping things
V0.202 	changed from a confusing "jog" setting to a grid concept for sorting. 
		It also changed the default from sort on Reference Designators to sort on Module locations.
V0.203	Cleaned up code. Do a global "round to grid". Write out coordinate file, update list, and 
		ref des change plan files (_coord.txt, _update.txt, _change.txt). 
		Removed Verbose, and Show Change Plan option. Fixed bug where ref des offset are relative to module
		axis not relative to module center


**** NOTE: If you get strange "out of order" results change the grid setting (usually higher works - to a point) ****


Instructions
1) Archive your KiCad project (just in case)
2) Verify and record/correct any schematic or DRC PCB errors
3) Run this program (RenumKiCadPCB)
4) Type in the input file name and set any other options. The maximum file name is 2048 characters 
   and if it contains spaces (i.e. this is a file) you probably need to surround it with ""
5) Open the project and create a netlist
6) Open the PCB and import the netlist 
	**** The first time you do this PCBNew will recreate the connectivity database
7) Run DRC and verify there are no new error, no connects, etc.

								****** KNOWN ISSUE ****** 
Due to abug in KiCad PCBNew ([Bug 1609401] Re: PCBnew fails to properly import netlist after changing 
annotation with pours see https://bugs.launchpad.net/kicad/+bug/1609401) 

If RenumKiCadPCB is run on a project with copper pours and a schematic netlist is created and imported
into PCBNew errors can occur in the netlist import and subsequent DRC. 

This happens even without using RenumKiCadPCB: sometimes after changing reference designations on 
PCB and eeSchema if you then generate a netlist and re-import it into PCBNew there may be netlist 
errors and DRC errors if the board has copper pours.

The fix is simple. Type 'B' and the pours will regenerate except where there are errors where they
appear hatched. Note the rats nest netlist name in the hatched error zone. Edit the zone (hit 'E' 
near a zone edge) and change the pour net to the rats net netlist name. (the rats nest name is usually
near the top of the selection window). Type 'B' again, and the pour will fill. Run DRC and the errors 
are gone.
	
I have filed a bug report with the KiCad developers regarding this issue.

RenumKiCadPCB Options 

V0.2 and after works on as a command line tool or a rudimentary menu based user interface.

Simply run RenumKiCadPCB and type in the input file at the prompt. When all the parameters are correct,
type "r" to run.

To use as a command line tool a typical invocation is

RenumberKiCadPCB -iRenumtest

The only required parameter is the input file (if you don't enter an imput file it will drop into menu mode)

-iInfile		The Input file names (infile.kicad_pcb,  infile.sch) (required)
		Infile is renamed infileRenumBack.kicad_pcb, infileRenumBack.sch

These are optional parameters:
-fs		Front sort direction																
		-fs[1ST][2ND] where [1ST or [2ND] are TB (top to bottom) or LR (left to right		
		DEFAULT is fsTBLR (top to bottom, left to right)
		
-bs		Bottom sort direction same arguments as -fs											
		DEFAULT is bsTBRL (top to bottom, right to left)									
		
-j		Set the Jog or the variability (+/-) between when a location is the same 			
		(i.e 0.1 and 0.15 are the same if jog is 0.5. –j0.1 means 0.1mm jog. 
		Default is 1mm.
		
-fp		Top refdes prepend string (i.e. tpT_ means R1 will be T_R1 if it is on top side		
		DEFAULT is empty																	
		
-bp		Bottom refdes prepend string (i.e. bpB_ means R2 will be B_R2 if it is on bottom side
		DEFAULT is empty																	
		
-fr		Top refdes start value (i.e. fp100 means parts will start at 100 on the front side	
		DEFAULT is 1																		
		
-br		Bottom refdes start value (i.e. br100 means R2 will be R102 if it is on bottom side
		DEFAULT is to continue from the last front refdes								
		
-m		Sort on module location. Default is sort on Ref Des Location						

-y		No Y/N question asked																

-c		Show change plan but don't update files												

-v		Verbose mode. Default is off														

-?		Print out command options
