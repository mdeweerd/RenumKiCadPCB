Linux make instructions

This should work for most versions of Linux but I tried it under Ubuntu

1) Create a directory (i.e. RenumKiCadPCB) and extract all the archive files into it. 
2) Delete RenumKiCadPCB.exe (the Windows executable)
3) Type make RenumKiCadPCB
4) You should now have an executable called RenumKiCadPCB. Under Ubuntu it is already executable.
5) Execute as ./RenumKiCadPCB
